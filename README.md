# SQL-Handlers
Used to perform SQL CRUD operations. The SQLDatabase class has been used with MS SQL Server Databases and MS Access Databases. Adjustments may be necessary for other types of SQL Databases (e.g., Oracle).

The SQLPyodbcHandler and SQLDatabase have proved useful. All code is a work in progress and may contain bugs.
